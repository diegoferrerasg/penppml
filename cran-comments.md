## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.

* I corrected a small bug that was causing an error in the CRAN checks.
* I added an option (colcheck) which allows to simultaneously check whether the independent variables are 
* collinear or are perfectly explained by the fixed effects.

## Test environments
* Windows 11, 64 bit, R 4.3.1
* Debian Linux, R-devel, clang, CRAN's setup

## R CMD check results

* Windows:
0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes

* Debian Linux:
0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes
