## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.

* I added an option to plugin Lasso (phipost) which allows the coefficient-specific penalty weights 
* to be iteratively calculated using estimates from a post-penalty regression.

## Test environments
* Windows 11, 64 bit, R 4.2.3
* macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra, R-release, CRAN's setup

## R CMD check results
